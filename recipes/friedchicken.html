    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken is a culinary classic celebrated for its irresistible combination of crispy, golden-brown skin and tender, juicy meat. This beloved dish is created by coating pieces of chicken in a seasoned flour mixture and then deep-frying them to achieve a crunchy exterior while sealing in the flavorful moisture. The key to perfect fried chicken lies in the seasoning, which typically includes a blend of spices such as paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper, adding layers of depth and heat.</p>
    <p>The frying process is carefully controlled to ensure that the chicken is cooked through yet remains moist and succulent inside. Whether enjoyed as a comforting family meal, a picnic favorite, or a party staple, fried chicken offers a satisfying crunch and savory taste that has made it a cherished dish across cultures and cuisines.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and pat dry the chicken pieces with paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, pour buttermilk over the chicken pieces. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>

        <li>Remove chicken pieces from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the flour mixture, ensuring an even coating.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add chicken pieces to the hot oil, working in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C).</li>
        <li>Use a slotted spoon or tongs to remove the chicken from the oil. Place on a rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
